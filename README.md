Part 3 of this POE consists of  WPF GUI application. 
This still keeps all the functions from part 1 and 2 but displays them in a GUI.
Part 3 now allows the user to create tasks and the Chatbot will remind the user of this on any date chsoden by the user.
The GUI now contains a mini game/ Quiz which tests the user on cybersecurity topics.
The quiz is multiple choice where the user must select the number of the asnwer rather than typing the entire answer out in full.
There have been major changes made to the file structure compared to parts 1 and 2, these changes include:
Converting the code from 2 classes to 1
Creating a new project to facilitate the WPF GUI Application.
